It was targeted at customers, to be used in websites, web applications and mobile applications. By making it freely available, it saved traffic (through compression) and offloaded the main servers, because customers didn&#39;t have to use poor self-written scripts for image resizing. We gained experience with different user cases, and the separation from the main servers enabled us to use the latest and greatest software stack.</p><h2 id="how-are-you-funded" tabindex="-1">How are you funded? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-are-you-funded" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How are you funded?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Since 2011 wsrv.nl is privately funded, and used as a testbed for new techniques in resizing, recognition and processing. Operating costs of the image service are very low. To prevent conflicts of interest, we never accepted any (financial) compensation or donation since we started, and we don&#39;t affiliate. Our intent is to keep the service running for many years to come.</p><p>Try it for yourself, if you experience problems or if it doesn&#39;t meet expectations, contact us.</p><h2 id="are-there-any-limitations" tabindex="-1">Are there any limitations? <a class="header-anchor" href="#are-there-any-limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Are there any limitations?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There is a filter on the origin domain name. This means that we refuse to download images from certain websites, to prevent our service from being blocked by others. This filtering is handled by <a href="https://community.opendns.com/domaintagging/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenDNS domain tagging</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, there is a request limit per visitor IP for uncached requests, which is 2500 images per 10 minutes, after which the IP-address will be blocked for 1 hour.</p><p>We are not a fan of filtering or limitations, but even more so, we are not a fan of being filtered.
