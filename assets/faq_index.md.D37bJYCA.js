It was targeted at customers, to be used in websites, web applications and mobile applications. By making it freely available, it saved traffic (through compression) and offloaded the main servers, because customers didn&#39;t have to use poor self-written scripts for image resizing. We gained experience with different user cases, and the separation from the main servers enabled us to use the latest and greatest software stack.</p><h2 id="how-are-you-funded" tabindex="-1">How are you funded? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-are-you-funded" aria-label="Permalink to “How are you funded?”">​</a></h2><p>Since 2011 wsrv.nl is privately funded, and used as a testbed for new techniques in resizing, recognition and processing. Operating costs of the image service are very low. To prevent conflicts of interest, we never accepted any (financial) compensation or donation since we started, and we don&#39;t affiliate. Our intent is to keep the service running for many years to come.</p><p>Try it for yourself, if you experience problems or if it doesn&#39;t meet expectations, contact us.</p><h2 id="are-there-any-limitations" tabindex="-1">Are there any limitations? <a class="header-anchor" href="#are-there-any-limitations" aria-label="Permalink to “Are there any limitations?”">​</a></h2><p>There is a filter on the origin domain name.

Some browsers will try to validate assets every few minutes if you serve them a &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header, and that&#39;s why I would advise to disable the use of it completely.</p><p>If you want more information about the headers we serve, consider using <a href="https://redbot.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">REDbot.org</a> this will explain every header we serve, and why this is used. We also serve Cache-Control: public, this allows browsers to cache things even when accessing wsrv.nl over https://.</p><p>Let us know if you need more info. We are open for comments about the caching policies we use. We do run complete tests on server load, bandwidth, and CPU-cycles, for each header we place. Enabling 304 will generate 5 times more requests from browsers in our case, this could be different for your site, but I expect it to be the same.</p><h2 id="what-if-i-still-have-a-question" tabindex="-1">What if I still have a question? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-if-i-still-have-a-question" aria-label="Permalink to “What if I still have a question?”">​</a></h2><p>That means you&#39;re unique, and one of a kind!
